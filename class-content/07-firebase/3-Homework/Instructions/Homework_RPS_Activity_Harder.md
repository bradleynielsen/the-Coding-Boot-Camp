# Week 7 Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors

##### *RPS? Again?! Whaaaat?!!*

### Overview
In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

### Remember

* You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

### Some Notes Before you begin

* Whether you finish the game or not, you must hand in your code by `< HEY, INSTRUCTOR: FILL THIS PART IN :) >` to avoid having your work marked incomplete. We don't expect every student to finish this assignment. Still, we do want to see you program this game as best you can.

### When Should You Be an Expert with the Concepts from This Homework?

By Week 9. Try your *absolute best* to finish this homework. Remember: you have two weeks to ace this exercise.

### Setup
1. Create a GitHub repo called `RPS-Multiplayer` and clone it to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of your `RPS-Multiplayer` folder called `index.html`. This is where your page's HTML will go.
  * Don't forget to include [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.min.js) and [Firebase](https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.4.1/firebase.js).

3. Inside `RPS-Multiplayer`, create your `assets` directory.
  * Create the folders and files you typically place in `assets` -- just like you had for the prior weeks' homework assignments.

### Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:
  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Additional Practice and Support

* If you find your skills lacking in any of the subjects we taught you, look at your instructor's in class repository. 

  * Find the exercises that you did in class and redo them from scratch. It might seem redundant at first, but this will help edify the material.

  * You can also watch videos of this all of our past lectures--we've saved these to the repo.

* Like always, feel free to contact either your instructor or a TA if you'd like some one-on-one support. 
 
  **Good Luck!**
