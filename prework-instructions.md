# Cue the majestic music: It's time for Prework!

The deadline to watch and mirror all of these tutorials is **July 15th** at **midnight**.

Welcome to the prework -- and congrats on successfully using Bootcampspot.com to navigate your way to this markdown (.md) file in GitHub. Nice job! This is how you will continue to locate and access homework assignments throughout the course, so it's good to get some practice! 

In preparation for the first day of class, we have put together a short series of tutorials that will guide you through the steps of setting up your 'development environment' on your laptop. The links to these tutorials have been listed below - with separate versions for both mac and PC-users. Be sure to follow these tutorials **on the laptop that you plan to bring to class**. 

After you have completed the final tutorial Putting it Together with Sublime Text please ensure that you follow the instructions to submit the GitHub link to your code through [this form](

If you have questions, we will discuss them the first day of class, but do your best to finish the prework tutorials before noting your questions -- the answers may come up in later tutorials! :)
